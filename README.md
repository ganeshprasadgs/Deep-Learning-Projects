I presented a system that uses deep learning to classify the two diseases in potato plants based on leaf
conditions, using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to create an accurate classification
system. This experiment achieved around 98% accuracy using 32 batch sizes at 50 epochs and the
output has shown that CNN exceeds all existing tasks in the potato plant.
